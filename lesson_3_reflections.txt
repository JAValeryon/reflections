When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Remote copy, backup..
- Work from a different pc/location
- Allow collaboration!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Basically, because some of the changes may have not been done by me and need to be checked etc
- Maybe I'm pulling changes from a public repository not owned by me.. .
