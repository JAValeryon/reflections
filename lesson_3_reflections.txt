When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Remote copy, backup..
- Work from a different pc/location
- Allow collaboration!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Basically, because some of the changes may have not been done by me and need to be checked etc
- Maybe I'm pulling changes from a public repository not owned by me.. .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Fork: create a copy of a repository into my Github account (new repository is stored in Github servers)
- Clone: create a copy from a remote repository (can be located in Github, my pc, local network, etc) into my local folder on my pc (technically)
- branch: split a commit
