What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git metadata is created. 
Needed to start to track files for changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Allow me to separate files which I want to track and apply a version control and other files, which may be static and never changes or those which I am
 working with right now and are not ready to be commited.
