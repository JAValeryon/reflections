When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Remote copy, backup..
- Work from a different pc/location
- Allow collaboration!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Basically, because some of the changes may have not been done by me and need to be checked etc
- Maybe I'm pulling changes from a public repository not owned by me.. .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Fork: create a copy of a repository into my Github account (new repository is stored in Github servers)
- Clone: create a copy from a remote repository (can be located in Github, my pc, local network, etc) into my local folder on my pc (technically)
- branch: split a commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally
Work offline!

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Well.. using subversion? xDD or using a shared folder/dropbox/ etc and/or being in the same office

Easier: commmunication, resolve conflicts?
Harder: track changes, undo work without breaking main project?!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Same reasons/benefits as why to create a branch at first place with the idead of a pull request and allo others to review my work
before a merge to master.

Well, make changes directly to master seems more easier/fast but if more people are collaborating in the same repository it
may be more convenient to allow them to review the changes and approve it.
